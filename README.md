# Are We LibAdwaita Yet?

Welcome to the "Are We LibAdwaita Yet?" website, where you can explore a curated collection of apps that utilize `libadwaita`. While this list may not encompass every app in existence, it provides a snapshot of apps that we are aware of and welcomes contributions from the community to expand the selection.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's directory structure:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ static/          # Static assets like images
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/         # Shared components and utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/      # SvelteKit routes and pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.html     # HTML template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ app.css      # Global styles
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

SvelteKit looks for `.svelte` files in the `src/routes/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

The `src/lib/` directory is where we put shared components and utilities that can be imported using the `$lib` alias.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `static/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command           | Action                                       |
